a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
every curse has it's blessings.
so what if no one beleives in your dream, you don't need them to, it's yours.
the difference between a novice and a master is that the master has failed more times than the novice has tried
and the universe said I love you
and the universe said you have played the game well
and the universe said everything you need is within you
and the universe said you are stronger than you know
and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you
and the universe said the light you seek is within you
and the universe said you are not alone
yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift. that is why it's called the present.
don't fear failure. not failure but low aim is a crime. in great attempts it is glorious to fail
No matter what, you keep finding something to fight for.
For what is life if not the joys of doing everything other than Main Thing
Even we who ride times waves, cannot see times end
you can't keep blaming yourself. blame yourself once and move on.
